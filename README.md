As practice for GitHub and Amaranth, I'm designing a core using RISC-V ISA in this repository.
How far should I implement it? Would RV32IMAD be too much?
I'm also thinking about designing a SoC.
Regardless of where I set the goal, please refer to the TODO for the work I'm currently doing!

**TODO**
* Implement the I instructions of SISD
